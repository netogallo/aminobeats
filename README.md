You need Ruby with QT Bindings (qt-ruby) to use this. I'm am not sure how to do this in Windows or MacOS but it should be possible without much hassle: http://osake.wordpress.com/2009/08/21/qt4-qtruby-mac-os-x/.

See the demo.rb to understand how to use the gui.

You can run the demo with (after installing qt-ruby): ruby demo.rb
